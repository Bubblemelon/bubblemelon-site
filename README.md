My personal website.

Updates:

Wave.js for index page only works on firefox.

Note to Self

**Tools:**

(1) W3C HTML Validator

(2) W3C CSS Validator

(3) W3C Link Checker



**Things to remember:**


(4) Website site should always comply with xml, so make sure to always close elements e.g. ` <br/> or <li></li> `
	
(5) File names should not contain spaces

(6) CSS selectors in combination should not have spaces in between when being very specific/selective. 

(7) When used with spaces e.g. `.container .blue {}` means class blue in class container. 
	
(8) Use " , " to separate css selectors when applying to properties sperately.

(9) Use photoshop to condense pictures.
	
(10) Make sure all directory links are correct, which the W3C link checker can't detect.
