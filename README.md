My personal website.

Future Updates:
------

1. Mobile first ( To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the viewport meta tag to `<head>` element. )
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
Needs to be done on all pages.

2. Find a way to have the all code between the `<head></head>` element to place one file. Instead on all the pages... i.e. Using Javascript !!!

3. Dropdown button does not work on Firefox Focus Mobile.

4. Have the footer only show when user scrolls all the way to the bottom of the page on the mobile version

**Tools:**

(1) W3C HTML Validator

(2) W3C CSS Validator

(3) W3C Link Checker  

(4) [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)



**Things to remember:**


(4) Website site should always comply with xml, so make sure to always close elements e.g. ` <br/> or <li></li> `

(5) File names should not contain spaces

(6) CSS selectors in combination should not have spaces in between when being very specific/selective.

(7) When used with spaces e.g. `.container .blue {}` means class blue in class container.

(8) Use " , " to separate css selectors when applying to properties sperately.

(9) Use photoshop to condense pictures.

(10) Make sure all directory links are correct, which the W3C link checker can't detect.
