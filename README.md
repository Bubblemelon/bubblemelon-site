My personal website.

### Note to Self


Tools:

(1) W3C HTML Validator

(2) W3C CSS Validator

(3) W3C Link Checker



Things to remember:


* Website site should always comply with xml, so make sure to always close elements e.g. ` <br/> or <li></li> `
	
* File names should not contain spaces

* CSS selectors in combination should not have spaces in between when being very specific/selective. 

* When used with spaces e.g. `.container .blue {}` means class blue in class container. 
	
* Use " , " to separate css selectors when applying to properties sperately.

* Use photoshop to condense pictures.
	
* Make sure all directory links are correct, W3C link checker cannot detect.
